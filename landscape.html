				<h2>The Sandia Mountains</h2>
				<p>
					The Sandia Mountains are by far one of the most captivating aspects of the New Mexican landcape. These mountains are given their name "Sandia" which means "watermelon" in spanish because of the vibrant red glow the mountains radiate during sunsets in Albuquerque. To view the Sandia Mountains, one can hike up the iconic La Luz trail which is around a ~7 mile accending hike or use the Tramway which is an arieal tram that connects the base of the mountain to the peak. At the peak of the mountains there is a beautiful observation deck and multiple hiking trails to visit.

				<h2>The Rio Grande River</h2>
				<p>
					The Rio Grande River cuts through the middle of Albuquerque, New Mexico. THis river is surrounded by a small forest called "El Bosque" which comprises mostly of cottonwood tree. The Rio Grade extends from Colorado, through New Mexico, and into Texas. Although, the river is small it still provides a completly different ecosystem for animals outside of the regular New Mexican dessert terrain. Some locals like to kayak the river banks and there are many runnning and biking trails spanning the majority of the rivers length in Albuquerque.
